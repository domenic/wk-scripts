# Domenic's WaniKani Scripts

These are [userscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) for [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/), a Japanese language-learning site.

So far they are mostly forked from existing peoples' work, and updated for various reasons. See the [changelogs](./changelogs/) directory for more information.

To install and use them:

- Get the [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) extension for your web browser.
- Click on the script link you want to use. TamperMonkey should prompt you to install them automatically:

  - [Progress Colors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domenic/wk-scripts/master/scripts/progress-colors.user.js)
