# WaniKani Progress Colors Changelog

## 1.0.0

Based on [WaniKani progress colours](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/20637-wanikani-progress-colours) by [Chris Ward](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/49379-chris-ward).

* Modernized the codebase.
* Changed to add a single `<style>` element to the page instead of 22.
* Also changed the colors of the bars and items introduced by [Wanikani Ultimate Timeline](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/13475-wanikani-ultimate-timeline).
* Also changed the colors of the items displayed on [wkstats.com](https://www.wkstats.com/).
* Harmonized all different displays of the items to have the same gradient style.
* Removed (for now) recoloring of the "Percent Answered Correct" lattice pages. I think they need a different scheme than reusing the apprentice/guru/master/enlightened colors.
